Springboard useState Exercise

This is the useState exercise for the Springboard SEC course.  I actually had fun doing this assignment.  Technically, the assignment was small enough that you don't have to create separate components, but I prefer to separate things out into smaller pieces.  Planning how to compartmentalize and name things is what I found fun.  Getting everything to gel and render was a bit of a challenge, but as always, I learned a lot.

Going back to a React project was also a learning event.  Note to self, going forward to do not use spaces in naming Projects/Folder/Files and make sure you use "" around pathways when navigating to it from the terminal line.  Evidently, if you do not use quotes, you will get a "too many arguments" error because of the way the terminal parses everything. (i.e., cd "C:/Project-name")  

I tinkered around with CSS in this project, too.  I learned that you use different syntax for importing CSS files vs JSX files.  If you use the same syntax as JSX files, then it's being treated as a component.  You can't treat CSS as a component. The syntax is shorter.  (import "./Component.css")

My game is still hideous, but the challenge was finding where styles should go and getting all the files to "talk" to each other.  One day, I hope to create something pleasing to look at, but in the meantime I will take my wins where I can.
